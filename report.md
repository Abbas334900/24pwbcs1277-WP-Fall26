Git is a local version control system that tracks every change you make to your code, allowing you to "time travel" back to previous versions if something breaks.

GitHub acts as a cloud-based home for your Git repositories, making it easy to share your code, collaborate with others, and keep a backup of your work online.

Branches are independent lines of development that allow you to experiment with new features or fixes without messing up the main, stable version of your project.

I learned that using these tools together creates a professional workflow where mistakes are easy to undo and collaboration becomes seamless.

Mastering the terminal commands for adding, committing, and pushing code is the first major step toward becoming a more efficient and organized developer.
